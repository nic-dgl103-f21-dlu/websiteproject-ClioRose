    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Growing up in a small town on the West Coast of B.C. with a family that is very creative I always strived to be creative. I tried drawing, painting and pottery but was frankly terrible at all of them. When I first picked up my moms old camera I knew this was what I wanted to do. I've been a horse lover since before I could walk so it was a natural to combine my two favourite things.  I was very fortunate to be able to share a lot of my teen and early twenties with a cranky buckskin Quarter Horse named Babe. She could make you feel like the best rider in the world but also shatter the illusion pretty quickly. One of the things that drives me to take the best possible photos of people with their horses is that I don’t have a lot with her. The ones I do are very special to me. </p>
