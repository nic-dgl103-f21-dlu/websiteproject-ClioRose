    <h2>About</h2>
    <p><h3> I grew up in a small town on the West Coast of B.C.
        Growing up in a very creative family, I always strived to be creative myself. 
        I tried drawing, painting and pottery, but was frankly terrible at all of them.
        When I first picked up my moms old camera, I knew this was what I wanted to do. 
        I've been a horse lover since before I could walk, so it was a natural to combine my two favourite things.
        I was very fortunate to be able to share a lot of my early life with a cranky buckskin quarter-horse named Babe. 
        She could make you feel like the best rider in the world, and shatter the illusion quickly. 
        One of the things that drives me to take the best possible photos of people with their horses, is that I don’t have many with her. 
        The ones I do have are very special to me.</h3> </p>
